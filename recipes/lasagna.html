                    <h2>Directions</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li><h5>Step 1</h5>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
                        <li><h5>Step 2</h5>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
                        <li><h5>Step 3</h5>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley,
                             basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally</li>
                        <li><h5>Step 4</h5>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes.
                             Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
                        <li><h5>Step 5</h5>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
                        <li><h5>Step 6</h5>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                        <li><h5>Step 7</h5>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.
                             Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly.
                             Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. 
                             Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
                        <li><h5>Step 8</h5>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil:
                             to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
                        <li><h5>Step 9</h5>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
