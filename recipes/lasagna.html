                        <li class="ing-list"><h5>Step 2</h5>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>

                             basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally</li>
                        <li class="ing-list"><h5>Step 4</h5>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes.
