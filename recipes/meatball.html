        <h1>Swedish Meatballs (Svenska Kottbullar)</h1>
        <p>These Swedish meatballs are a Christmas tradition in our family. We frequently double the recipe and keep it warm in a slow cooker.
             Worth the effort, and the meatballs are even better the next day! 
             Reserve brown gravy and add sour cream to it the day you serve the leftovers.</p>

                <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
               <li> ¼ cup chicken broth</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
               <li> 2 cups beef broth, or as needed</li>
               <li> ½ (8 ounce) container sour cream</li>
             
             </ul>

             <h2>Directions</h2>
             <ol>
                <li><h5>Step 1</h5>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li><h5>Step 2</h5>Place bread crumbs into a small bowl; mix in cream. Allow to stand until crumbs absorb cream, about 10 minutes.</li>
                <li><h5>Step 3</h5>Meanwhile, melt 1 teaspoon butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion until light brown, about 10 minutes. Transfer onion to a mixing bowl.</li>
                <li><h5>Step 4</h5>Mix ground beef, ground pork, egg, brown sugar, salt, black pepper, nutmeg, allspice, and ginger with onion in the mixing bowl. 
                    Lightly mix in bread crumbs and cream.</li>
                <li><h5>Step 5</h5>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat. 
                    Pinch off about 1 ½ tablespoons meat mixture per meatball; form into balls. 
                    Place meatballs into the skillet and cook, turning often, until browned, about 5 minutes. Insides of meatballs will still be pink.</li>
                <li><h5>Step 6</h5>Place browned meatballs into a baking dish, pour in chicken broth, and cover with foil.</li>
                <li><h5>Step 7</h5>Bake in the preheated oven until meatballs are tender, about 40 minutes. Remove meatballs to a serving dish.</li>
                <li><h5>Step 8</h5>Pour pan drippings into a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk flour into drippings until smooth.</li>
                <li><h5>Step 9</h5>Gradually whisk in enough beef broth to total about 2 ½ cups liquid.</li>
                <li><h5>Step 10</h5>Bring gravy to a simmer, whisking constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li><h5>Step 11</h5>Just before serving, whisk in sour cream. Season with salt and black pepper. Serve gravy with meatballs.</li>
